## Application

The application is available [here](https://ntts-dashboard.lab.sspcloud.fr/). This application leverages card payments data to provide highly interactive data visualisation. The application offers two main features:
- Visualisation of spending indicators which closely match official indicators of short term statistics
- An early warning system which triggers alerts when sudden changes happen in consumer spending in any economic sector.
